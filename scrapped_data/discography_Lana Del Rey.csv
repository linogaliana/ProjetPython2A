I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left

[Chorus]
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

[Verse 2]
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, ""Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music.""
[Chorus]
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around

[Verse 3]
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that often9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord
Who abide in His shadow for life
Say to the Lord, ""My refuge
My rock, in whom I trust!""

And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn
Make you to shine like the sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

The snare of the fowler will never capture you
And famine will bring you no fear
Under His wings, your refuge
His faithfulness, your shield

Bear you on the brеath of dawn
Make you to shine like thе sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

You need not fear the terror of the night
Nor the arrow that flies by day
Though thousands fall about you
Near you it shall not come
[Chorus]
And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn
Make you to shine like the sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

[Verse 4]
For to His angels He's given a command
To guard you in all of your ways
Upon their hands they will bear you up
Lest you dash your foot against a stone

[Chorus]
And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn
Make you to shine like the sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things

[Verse 1: Barrie James O'Neill]
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Verse 2: Barrie James O'Neill]
My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mm, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
[Verse 3: Barrie James O'Neill & Lana Del Rey]
When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes (in my eyes)
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size(in my eyes, uh)
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime(Uh, Uh)
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oh, uh, Summer wine

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Barrie James O'Neill]
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine

0,​patent leather do-over,5601817,Lana Del Rey,behind the iron gates - insights from an institution,638881,"{'year': 2022, 'month': None, 'day': None}",Lana Del Rey,"Sylvia - I knew what you meant when you talked about swimming in the ocean and leaving your patent leather black shoes pointing towards it, while you swam

It tickled you to leave them there
It was the thought of a young child or of a lost fairy
That reminded me of who I am
That's why I am now at this facility by the ocean
And why I go barefoot and why I go calmly
Why I leave my shoes up by the stairway
I do it for you and I do it for me
Because having learned from others and from you
I learned there was a missing piece to finding existential calmness
And domestic bliss to lead to peace

You see, you can't fall in love with a man like Ted -
Or a musician who sings about being free
A woodworker doesn't a good man make, if he wants his work to be on TV
You have to separate the wheat from the chaff
You have to be discerning
It takes diligence, consequence and other things
To keep that sea from churning
And to keep yourself from longing to let those painted waves take you under
It isn't just the water black that makes the body plunder from high sea cliffs
I know my dear, I wish that I had been here or there
I wish that you were here now, if you're not now -
Because who knows how these things work?
Sylvia, Marilyn, Violet, Diana
All of my kind women who came before me, blonde
I dyed my hair black for you
I turned my back on that black pond
I swear I won't stop 'til I'm dead
And here I am at 34 - And what for?

To bring my pair of baby patent leather shoes to turn them the other way - towards the sea cliffs stairs not at the ocean
To bring them back up safe to the facility instead
And I think of you as I walk the 280 wooden steps -
Dynamited into the cliffs a hundred years before
I let myself into room 2 and got undressed

I was sunburnt, contemplative and sore
And as I fell asleep by Gabapentin
I lay my head on the pillow and streched my hand out on the cool white linen - and sing you lemon melody
I kept the shoes on the sill by the window seat -
In case you got restless and wanted to leave
And I hugged you with my baby's breath
And sang your spirit to bed
The way I would have if you were my child or if I had children
My Queen Anne's lace heart weightless on your little headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

[Pre-Chorus]
And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

[Chorus]
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' ""Black Lives Matter"" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah
[Verse 2]
Could we do this dance again?
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back?
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

[Pre-Chorus]
People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
In the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

[Chorus]
You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free

There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, ""How the hell did you get there?""
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

[Verse 2]
There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, ""A place I don't remember""
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, ""Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age""
She said ""You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy""
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who
[Chorus]
Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

[Verse 3]
There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

[Verse 4]
'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
In my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause
[Chorus 2]
Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters grey
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin', bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

[Outro]
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint34EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', ""Hey, you, baby, let's go""
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Verse 2]
My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover
[Chorus]
In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

[Outro]
They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to you
I'm leavin' them as I was, five-foot-eight, Western belt
Plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for you
But you'll need a miracle, America53EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

It's LA, ""Hey"" on Zoom, Target parking lot

Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one, too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit

Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do

Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothing to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that?
[Pre-Chorus]
I guess I'm complicated, my life's sorta, too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit

Here's the deal
’Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
I promise you, like, a million tomorrows
Here's the deal
What I can promise is I’ll lie down
Like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily

Baby, I, I, I, I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee
I'm better with you

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I’ll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I’ll do my best never to turn into something
That burns, burns, burns

So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, stand still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry

IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn (It from you, babe)

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn

But God, it feels good not to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it movin', babe

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Verse 2]
Troubled by my circumstancе
Burdened by the wеight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

[Pre-Chorus]
And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancin', babe
[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it movin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die

[Bridge]
I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killin' it, talkin' shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearin' it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been coverin' Joni and I'm dancin' with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rollin' like a rollin' stone

[Chorus]
So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it movin', babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancin', babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancin' 'til we die
We'll keep walkin' on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die
And we won't stop dancin' 'til we die23EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shoppin' today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standin' on a noisy corner
Waitin' for the walkin' green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free

[Verse 3: Weyes Blood]
Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playin' real good for free16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security
LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post
LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you

You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me
So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

My mind made up
Things that would make me happy

Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought

And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman

Waiting for the fireworks to begin

Untouchable, safe, otherworldy
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized

may they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
so as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime i've found are inconsequential
compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most
questions
there are no reasons

And if there are - i'm wrong
but at least i won't have spent my life waiting
looking for God in the clouds of the dawn

I'll be up early to rise though of course -
but only to make you a pot of coffee

That's what i was thinking this morning Joe
that it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
that i pray that i may
always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
never downcast at the table cloth

You see, Joe
it's times like this that the marine layer lifts
off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
that i think to myself
there are things you still don't know about me
like sometimes i'm afraid my sadness is too big
and that one day you might have to help me handle it
But until then
may my eyes always stay level to the skyline
assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
never higher than the tallest building
never to heaven or revenant
'Cause i have faith in man as strange as that seems
in times like these
and it's not just because of the warmth i've found in your
brown eyes
It's because i believe in the goodness in me
that it's firm enough to plant a flag in

6,SportCruiser,5750461,Lana Del Rey,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,592376,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}",Lana Del Rey,"I took a flying lesson on my 33rd birthday, instead of calling you
Or parking on the block where our old place used to be

Genesee, genesee, genesee

Pathetic, I know - but sometimes I still like to park on that street,
And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you

I was once in love with my life here,
In that studio apartment with you
Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view,
Out of the only window,
Big enough for me to see our future through
But it turned out I was the only one who could see it

Stupid apartment complex
Terrible you
You, who I wait for
You, you, you
Like a broken record stuck on loop

So that day, on my birthday, I thought
""Something has to change""
You can’t always be about waiting for you

Don’t tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator
The captain of the sky,
That perhaps I could stop looking for direction
from you
Well, what started off as an idea on a whim,
Has turned into something more
Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing
I’ve continued to go to classes each week
At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy

And everything was going fine
We were starting with dips and loops
and then something terrible happened

During my fourth lesson in the sky
My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you
Instructed me to do a simple maneuverer
It’s not that I didn’t do it,
But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right hand upward turn
Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane

Not tactfully and not gently
The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said
“You don’t trust yourself”

I was horrified
Feeling as though I’d somehow been found out
Like he knew me
How weak I was
Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky
But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words
For me, they held a deeper meaning
I didn’t trust myself

Not just 25,000 feet above the coast of Malibu
But with anything
And I didn’t trust you

I could’ve said something but I was quiet
Because pilots aren’t like poets
They don’t make metaphors between life and the sky

In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination,
I also decided to do something else I always wanted to do
Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for the class as ""Elizabeth Grant"",
And nobody blinked an eye

So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say
“You’re not a captain of a ship, or a master of the sky!”
No, the fisherman didn’t care, and so neither did I

And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before

Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain’s lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea

Midway through my forehead burned,
and my hands raw from driving
The captain told me the most important thing I’d need to know on the sea
“Never run the ship into irons”
That’s nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind

In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from

And you might not have time to look up to the mast,
Or up further to the weathervane
So you have to feel where the wind is coming from
On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they’re rolling

To do this, he gave me an exercise
He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing
I already knew I was going to get it wrong
“The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over” I told him
“No”, he said “the wind is coming from the left. The portside”
I sat waiting for him to tell me “You don’t trust yourself”

But he didn’t, so I said it for him
“I don’t trust myself”

He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level

“It’s not that you don’t trust yourself” he said. “it’s simply that you’re not a captain. It isn’t what you do”

Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better

“Which grocery store do you go to?” he asked
“To the Ralphs in the Palisades” I replied

“Okay. When you’re in the Ralphs in the Palisades,
I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store,
To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing
Now, I don’t want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot,
but everywhere you go,
I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from
And then, determine if it’s from the port or starboard side,
So when you’re back on the boat you have a better sense of it”

I thought his advice was adorable
I could already picture myself in the parking lot,
Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on

I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing
And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself
I thought of mentioning it,
but I didn’t
Because captain’s aren’t like poets
They don’t make metaphors between sea and sky

And as I thought that to myself,
I realized
that’s why I write
All of this circumnavigating the earth,
Was to get back to my life
Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise

I’m not a captain,
I’m not a pilot
I write!
I write2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Except for a healer on 6th street in Ridgely
Tessa DiPietro,
recommended casually by a medium I no longer know

She said my number one problem was that my field was untrusting
When asked what to do, she paused and said “Nothing”
Which sent me right into uncontrollable sobbing

Because there’s never anything you can do about the important things

She said “Okay, one thing you can do is picture the floor rising up to support you,
And sink into the back of the bed that’s behind you
Too much of your energy is in front and above you”

Which, for some reason, made me think of a live show I’d seen
Jim Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl, 1968, check date

The blue trellis lights gave him an unusual aura
Like a halo or something
Made him 8 feet or taller

I remember just thinking he looked out of his body
but definitely like a god on stage

So I told her “Maybe an artist has to function a little bit above themselves,
If they really want to transmit some heaven”
And she told me
""A singleness of focus is the key to transmission,
For an emphasis on developing inner intuition,
Close your eyes and feel where you hold your attention

If it’s in the back of your eyes
Walk it down to your heart’s centre
and make that the new place from which your thoughts enter

Clairvoyance comes mostly from this simple function
Oh - and Jim died at 27
So find another frame of reference
When you’re referencing heaven

And have you ever read the lyrics to ‘People are Strange’?
He made no sense!""2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

11,My Bedroom is a Sacred Place Now – There Are Children at the Foot of My Bed,5750462,Lana Del Rey,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,592376,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}",Lana Del Rey,"Last year, when I wrote you my last letter
the beginning of my future poetry
I acknowledged who you really were for the first time

I didn’t call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
that the devil is a real devil
and that monsters don’t always know that they’re monsters

But projection is an amazing thing
after you left and burnt the house down
you tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didn’t know who I was, but I do

I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
she would say ""camp fire smoke""

I’m gentle
I’m funny when I’m drunk
But I haven’t been drunk for 14 years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don’t know that I’m crazy
I can do that
I can do anything
Even leave you
Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed
telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later
And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur

And the longer I stay here
the more I am sure
But the more I step into becoming a poet
The less I will fall into being with you

The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into bed with you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
12,Paradise Is Very Fragile,5749085,Lana Del Rey,Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass,592376,"{'year': 2020, 'month': 7, 'day': 28}",Lana Del Rey,"Paradise is very fragile,
and it seems like it's only getting worse

Down here in Florida
We’re fighting red toxic tides
Mass of fish kills
Not to mention hurricanes and rising sea levels
Back in Los Angeles, things aren't looking much better
My treehouse that'd been standing for 80 years succumbed to the woolsy fire

Who would’ve thought that this year at 33
You would've been taken out from under me
After all those years?

Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner
Quiet World War One, aviation pilot
I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important

Paradise is very fragile,
and it seems like it's only getting worse

Our leader is a megalomaniac,
And we've seen that before
But never 'cause it was what the country deserved
My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture,
but it's either that or I 5150 myself

They don't understand
I'm a dreamer
And I had big dreams for the country
Not for what it could do, but how it could feel
How it could think, how it could dream

I know
Who am I to dream for you?
It’s just that in my own mind
I was born with a little bit of paradise
I was lucky in that way
Not like my husband
Who was born and raised in hell

I always had something gentle to give
All of me, in fact
It’s one of the beautiful things about me
It's one of the beautiful things about nature

But lately I’ve been thinking that I wish
Someone had told me when I was younger
More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise
That should they take too much,
There would be nothing left to give
Not everyone's nature is golden and green
And you can't fight what's in your nature

I got to thinking about it as
We were fighting the fires in Agora
But I’m tired of fighting you

Paradise is very fragile,
and it's only getting worse

And every time I think of that,
I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve,
She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree
And this summer night, you in front of me,
Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil

Because you take and you take and you take and you take,
But you taste like the beach and a kiss
Candy from my eyes
In my veins you run citrus

Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees
Arise in my midst
Kundalini, you breathe me
I could do this forever
But my heart is very fragile,
and I have nothing left to give1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
don't fall away like all the others

[Stanza 2]
Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
lovers and -

[Stanza 3]
The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
that they uttered

[Stanza 4]
Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

[Stanza 5]
Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

[Stanza 6]
But alas this is a real life - and it's been a real fight just to
stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask?
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
started to believe them
[Stanza 7]
But anyways - that's all over now

[Stanza 8]
I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left?
South Dakota?

[Stanza 9]
Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had?

[Stanza 10]
Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
of the warm embrace I've never got

Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
into stew

We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night

Playing games of levitation

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

[Verse 2]
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""
[Chorus]
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

[Bridge]
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

[Chorus]
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad

Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me have patience
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches

Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin' they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

[Chorus]
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
[Verse 2]
I was at Coachella leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

[Pre-Chorus]
What about all these children and all their children's children?
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend

I check in, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money

Living like a cyclone
Was I in your heart?
Guess I’ll never know where you go
Harsh words in the headlamps
Time to leave

Racing like a psycho
Walking on a tightrope
Funky like a monkey
With my makeup running
Too proud to find no time to breathe

Almost brought me down to my knees
You said I've never been clear
Honey, you better believe
Now that there's nothing to fear

Walking like I'm tanked up
Reading from the black book
Everyone you know is a roady-go sinner

Loaded like a weapon
Bombing down jacina like the end is coming
I prophesize you'll miss the highs with me

You can paint it all black

Are both perhaps present in time future

I was so wrong not to doubt your Medellín, tangerine dreams

[Bridge]
Catch me if you can, working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain
Ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat soft ice cream

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
""I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on""
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Post-Chorus]
Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
In all the wrong places
Oh my God
[Verse 2]
Carry me home, got my new coat and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listenin' to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Post-Chorus]
Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
[Bridge]
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

[Chorus]
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
And all I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

[Outro]
It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again

I'm on my own again

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

[Chorus]
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love
[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your money now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything

[Pre-Chorus]
Nothing could stop
The two of us
Let's just get lost
That's what we want

[Chorus]
And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

[Verse 2]
Dive in, dive deep and dive blue, my sweet
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away
[Pre-Chorus]
But nothing could stop
The two of us
If that's what we want
We could just get lost

[Chorus]
And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

[Bridge]
Do you like
Do you like where you've been and where you're going to?
(Going to)
Say goodnight
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
I'm gonna follow you

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
And I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
[Bridge]
'Cause I love you
Oh, baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

[Verse 1]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Verse 2]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand
[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach

All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
